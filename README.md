# Memory Game Challenge

The purpose of this was to practice using the DOM and the browser's 
local storage.

This is a single page app of a pair-matching game.  The game starts off 
with several pairs of cards of colors faced down.  Clicking on a card 
reveals the color.  After clicking on a second card, if the colors 
don't match, then the cards' colors will be hidden again.  A score is 
tallied during play, and the best score across plays will be saved in 
the browser's local storage and shown on the webpage.

The randomization and the HTML creation of the cards were already 
provided.  I added the logic for interacting with the cards, keeping 
track of matched cards, checking the win condition, all of scoring, and 
all of the CSS.
